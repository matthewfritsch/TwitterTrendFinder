In the process of writing this program, there were many things I did not consider. The web crawler grabbing MORE than 50 trends on a single date was one of those things. After reviewing the results and noticing there were 142k trends in the text file, I knew something was wrong: with over 1,625 days with 50 trends per day, there should not be >100k trends. The crawler had also grabbed onto the Google trends for some days, so there were 51-100 trends on those days instead of 50. The first 50 trends in the file were Twitter trends, and all trends after that were Google trends. I fixed the main program by only returning the first 50 results in pageReader.py, but I refuse to rerun it for five-and-a-half boring hours again.
This folder contains one .py file that has two purposes: The file removes all trends after 50. It then sorts them in order of date, preserving trend order.

Note to self: please make sure your program works properly *before* you start adding entries to a database.
