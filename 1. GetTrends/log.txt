Note: The website being used to gather trends has two ordered lists of trends. The first is visible before the button press, and the second is not. Not all trends exist since the creation of Twitter, just the ones that this website has gathered. Therefore, only trends since 2016-02-01 will exist.

Update (8/17): In case the site had a check to see if a bot was moving through every date sequentially, each set of trends was gathered in random order. In order to not spam the website with requests, I added a sleep to trendFinder. Each request will now take a total of 12 seconds. Given there is a request for each day, and a 12 second delay for each day, the program completed the job in 5 hours and 32 minutes. The db is now full of all trends between Feb 1 2016 and Aug 14 2020. I will consider posting the results here when they are sorted, though I'm unsure if Twitter would have a problem with that.

Update (8/25): The file 'trends.txt' now exists in the Results folder.
